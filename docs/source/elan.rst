ELAN builder
============

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ELAN .eaf builder exports eaf files ready to be annotated
with the ELAN software, based on either the `ACLEW DAS templates <https://osf.io/aknjv/>`_
or custom templates.

The `original code <https://github.com/aclew/EAF_builder_scripts/tree/Second-Version>`_ was written
by Sarah Mac Ewan.

This pipeline allows to pre-fill the .eaf annotations by importing speech (i.e. diarization annotations) from previous
annotations, e.g. those generated by the LENA or the VTC, or even manual annotations.

Usage
~~~~~

.. clidoc::

   child-project eaf-builder --help

Pre-filled annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The .eaf files can be pre-filled according to previous annotations by using the ``--path`` and ``--import-speech-from`` switches.
The ``--path`` option specifies the path to the dataset (i.e. the source project).
The ``--import-speech-from`` specifies the set of annotations to import speech from.
The pipeline will create and populate tiers named according to either the value of ``speaker_id`` or, alternatively, ``speaker_type``
for each annotation of that set.
