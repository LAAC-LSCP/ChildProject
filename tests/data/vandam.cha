@Comment:	For the "group" field of the Target_Child, identify (if
	known) HH=hard-of-hearing, CI=cochlear implant, TD=typically
	developing
@Comment:	Direction postcodes apply to all speakers except target
	child (CHI). Direction: Child-Directed utterance (adult to the
	target child) = [+ id]; Other-Directed utterance (adult to other
	children, adults) = [+ od]; Child-Directed-from-child
	(target child-directed speech from another child) = [+ ccd]; Unknown
	= [+ un]
@Comment:	For non-word infant utterances produced by the
	target-infant, we identify Vocalization Type; Canonical (contains
	canonical syllable) = [+ c]; Reflexive (laugh, cry) = [+ r];
	Non-Canon/Non-Reflex = [+nc]
@Comment:	For vetted utterances, use the postcodes [+ cut1] or
	[+ cut2]; the postcode must be followed by a space, and it is placed
	at the end of the utterance after the final delimter but before the
	bullet marking the time values; see Vetting Manual for more details
